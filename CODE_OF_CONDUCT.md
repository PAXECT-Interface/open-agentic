# Code of Conduct – Open Agentic 2.0

Open Agentic 2.0 is an audit-first, community-driven project.  
We want this space to be safe, respectful, and welcoming for everyone.

This Code of Conduct applies to:

- this repository (issues, pull requests, discussions),
- any community spaces linked from this project (for example chat, forums),
- all interactions under the Open Agentic name.

## Our values

- Be **respectful** – disagree with ideas, not with people.
- Be **constructive** – focus on improving the project.
- Be **honest** – no fake results, no falsified benchmarks, no hidden agendas.
- Be **inclusive** – this project is for people from all backgrounds.

You don’t have to be perfect. You do have to be respectful.

- Publishing other people’s private information (“doxing”) without consent.
